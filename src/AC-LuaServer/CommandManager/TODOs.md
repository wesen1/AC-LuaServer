-- TODO: For now: Command usage limit per user (1 command every 2 seconds for example)
-- TODO: In future: Background service that does command stuff, however it will also need a way to fetch data from the server via IPC


-- TODO: Always allow commands for server admins (!cmds, !help, !changeMode) ? => I think not
--       -> Should be an extension to the GameModeManager: A global command !changeMode


-- TODO: Make it possible to have some players that are not COmmandUser's? => level -1



-- TODO: Need CommandUserLevel manager
